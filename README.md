## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Angular](https://angular.io/) - Angular

### What I learned

The biggest thing that I learned from solutioning this challenge is to use Angular as the framework. I have no experience in using any front-end Javascript frameworks before in creating a website, usually I just go by vanilla HTML and CSS. This helps me understand about building website with components and models.

I have also applied my knowledge in creating layouts using flexbox in this challenge. At first, I had some trouble laying out the stats in a row, turns out I just need to encapsulate them in another div class with row as its flex-direction. This simple problem took me a while to fix but I am glad that I managed to lay it out properly. 

Lastly, it is also my first time deploying an Angular project using github, thus I spent many hours figuring out why my page returns a 404 error. After properly reading through instructions and multiple times of trying, I managed to launch it. For me, these are all achievements that I am proud of.

### Useful resources

## Acknowledgments

I would not have the biggest drive to start this challenge without the encouragement and trust of my team in EDS to appoint and train me as a front-end developer. That has been my dream job since I was 12 and it is a big thing to be given the opportunity to step into the role. The drive came from the fact that I don't want to be a liability to the team but instead, someone that could come in handy and produces good results. Thank you very much EDS Dev Team, for this drive you give me.
